hi guys today's video is going to be an easy how to make slime tutorial for beginners and I really hope that you find it helpful the first thing that you're going to need is a slime activator I recommend using one teaspoon of borax to two cups of warm water and then mixing it in really thoroughly when you add it to the glue it's going to help everything Clump together and this is going to make the Slime after we've made this mixture we're just going to go ahead and choose our glue my favorite glue to use for slime is Elmer's glue but you can use any glue containing polyvinyl alcohol after we've chosen our glue we can go in with the activator and start adding it really slowly it's important to add it slowly whilst mixing in because the solution can very easily become rubbery so once it starts pulling away from the bowl like this you want to pick it up in your hands and start playing with it this is going to help the Slime come together a bit more and get rid of the lumps and make it less sticky this is the basic slime recipe but there are a few ingredients you can add to slime to make it a bit bigger and also more fun to play with one of the most common mixtures for slime is slime and shaving foam you want to add the Shaving foam after you've added the glue and I like using a lot probably about a one to one ratio of glue to shaving foam just to make it super fluffy and also give me a lot of slime I mix it in with a spatula just so I can get all the product off the sides and mix in everything really thoroughly because of the Shaving foam you're not going to need much activator there's something in it that reacts with activating but more quickly than normal glue so I only needed about five pumps so you want to add it really slowly and then once it starts sticking away from the side of the bowl you just want to start playing with it with your fingers just to help it get out all the lumps and make it less stringy and you're left with this really fluffy big product this is one of the best slides to play with because it's so jiggly and it stretches and it's just so so fun and really cheap to make another popular slime combination is glue shaving foam and also cornstarch like the previous recipe I like to add the same amount of glue as I do shaving foam and then I like to add four heaped tablespoons of cornstarch once I've done this I just go ahead and mix it all in it does take me about three to five minutes because I don't sip the cornstarch but if you sift the cornstarch in it only takes about two minutes then you want to start adding your activator really slowly and this activates so so quickly because there's so many ingredients besides gluing it so you don't need to add very much and I did find that it was really hard to mix in because it was so thick so don't be ashamed to just go in with your hands and start adding activator that way it does take a while to kind of knead out all the lumps because it is such a thick mix but when it comes out it's so so fluffy and fun to play with I always find that it holds shape a lot better than when I add just shaving foam this is why I like this mixture the best I mixed all my slimes together and as you can see it creates a really really nice texture and it's a lot nicer than just having glue and activator I really hope that you enjoyed this video and if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up and also subscribe see you next week
